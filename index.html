            <h3>Why Denali?</h3>
            <h2>Wildlife Viewing in Denali National Park</h2>
            <p>
              Denali National Park ranks high on traveler bucket lists for its
              vast spruce and taiga forests; snaking glacial rivers and valleys;
              alpine vegetation; towering, polychromatic Alaska Range peaks
              (Mount McKinley, North America’s tallest peak, is located here);
              and unparalleled wildlife viewing opportunities. From mammoth
              grizzly bears and moose to Dall sheep, caribou and wolves, this
              remote wilderness is a treasure trove for animal seekers willing
              to travel quietly and keep their eyes peeled for even the smallest
              of movements.
            </p>
            <p>
              The park is home to 39 species of mammals, from small to
              large—you’ll just need a good amount of luck and patience to spot
              them. Make sure to bring a good pair of binoculars with you and
              have your camera at the ready. Whether you see the animals you’re
              hoping to or not, Denali’s pristine natural settings offer up
              jaw-dropping vistas and 169 species of birds that promise to amaze
              you.

                <h4 class="text-center">Mount Denali cloud</h4>
                <p>
                  Denali (Mount McKinley) is the highest mountain in North
                  America, but controversy surrounds both its height and name.
                  With a peak at 6,190 meters (20,310 feet), Alaska's Denali has
                  the highest elevation in North America.
                </p>
                <h4>Centerpiece of the Denali National Park and Preserve</h4>
                <p>
                  Denali is about 210 kilometers (130 miles) north-northwest of
                  Anchorage. Sixty million years ago, tectonic uplift pushed
                  Earth's crust upward, forming Denali and the other Alaska
                  Range mountains. Denali is the centerpiece of the Denali
                  National Park and Preserve, which spans 2.4 million hectares
                  (6 million acres) of land. “Denali” comes from Koyukon, a
                  traditional Native Alaskan language, and means “the tall one.”
                  This name had been used for many generations and was used by
                  early non-Native researchers and naturalists. But in 1896,
                  William A. Dickey, a prospector, began calling Denali “Mount
                  McKinley,” in honor of William McKinley, a presidential
                  candidate at the time.

              <div class="card-body">
                <h4 class="text-center">What to see Denali</h4>
                <p>
                  Denali is so big that it creates its own weather and is often
                  shrouded in clouds. Less than 30% of travelers visiting Denali
                  National Park ever see the mountain. So if you do see it,
                  consider yourself lucky. However, there are ways to increase
                  your chances. When the mountain is “out,” it can be seen from
                  as far away as Anchorage, but you need to know where to look.
                </p>

                <h4>How long to stay in Denali National Park?</h4>
                <p>
                  It is not possible to visit Denali in one day, unless you are
                  simply flying over it. Many tours visiting the park entrance
                  will spend as few as two nights, but even this only allows for
                  one full day of exploration, usually on a bus. Thus, my
                  recommendation on how long to stay in Denali National Park is
                  to spend at least three nights, preferably in Kantishna, in
                  order to truly explore this massive park. If the trip from
                  Anchorage to Kantishna is too long of a travel day for you,
                  consider adding one day at the park entrance. This way you can
                  enjoy the park entrance while also appreciating the solitude
                  of the park’s interior.

                <h4 class="text-center">Wildlife Viewing</h4>
                <p>
                  Generally speaking, your best chances to see wildlife will be
                  while riding a bus ride on the Denali Park Road. A bus offers
                  numerous advantages for the wildlife seeker. some trips are
                  lucky and see a wide variety of wildlife, while others are
                  less lucky and may only see a handful of animals.
                </p>

                <h4>By Species</h4>

                <ul class="card-ul">
                  <li>Moose</li>
                  <ol>
                    Sightings are comparatively frequent between the entrance
                    and Savage River.
                  </ol>
                  <li>Dall sheep</li>
                  <ol>
                    heep can often be seen high up on mountains overlooking
                    Igloo Canyon (approximately Miles 34 - 38).
                  </ol>
                  <li>Bears</li>
                  <ol>
                    Denali has grizzly and black bears, but it is very rare to
                    see a black bear.
                  </ol>
                  <li>Caribou</li>
                  <ol>
                    Caribou tend to be in small groups in summer, though on
                    occasion large herds will gather (100+ animals).
                  </ol>
                  <li>Wolves</li>
                  <ol>
                    Wolves vary quite a bit depending on where packs are
                    denning.
